👋 Hi, I’m Miguel

Currently I am working as a Data Scientist in Portugal. I have a background in Physics and Applied Mathematics. 
In my free time I spend a lot of time reading (anything about Tech and Science :books: or some other random stuff), learn more about programming (currently doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)) and I've started to learn how to make craft beer :beer:!


My "The Odin Project" projects:

- The Foundations:
    - [Landing Page](https://mvazramos.github.io/landing-page/)
    - [Rock Paper Scissors](https://mvazramos.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)   
    - [Etch-a-Sketch](https://mvazramos.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
    - [Calculator](https://mvazramos.github.io/calculator-top/)
- Full Stack JavaScript:
    - [Sign-up Form](https://mvazramos.github.io/signup-form-top/)
