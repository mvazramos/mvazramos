👋 Hi, I’m Miguel

Currently I am working as a Data Scientist in Portugal. I have a background in Physics and Applied Mathematics. 
In my free time I spend a lot of time reading (usually about Statistics or anything about Tech and Science :books:), learn more about programming (currently doing The Odin Project :computer:) and I've started to learn how to make craft beer :beer:!


My "The Odin Project" projects:

- The Foundations:

    - [Rock Paper Scissors](https://mvazramos.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)   
    - [Etch-a-Sketch](https://mvazramos.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
    - [Calculator](https://mvazramos.github.io/calculator-top/)
